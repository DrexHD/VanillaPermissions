# Vanilla Permissions

This mod adds permission checks into vanilla, to allow for full permission customization.

* You need to have a permissions mod installed. (e.g. [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net))
  (Any permission provider mod that supports [fabric-permissions-api](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api) is also supported.)

## Commands
Command permissions use the node system of [brigadier](https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier). Each node has its own 
permission, e.g. to get access to the `/gamemode survival` command `minecraft.command.gamemode` permission is required 
for access to the `/gamemode` command node, and `minecraft.command.gamemode.survival` is required to be able to run 
`/gamemode survival`. If you wish to grant full access to a command you need to give access to all child nodes, e.g.
`minecraft.command.gamemode.*`.

## Quality of Life

### Server Side
* If the mod is installed server-side, it will make clients think they're OP. This allows players with [appropriate 
permissions](#permissions) to place operator blocks and access the gamemode switcher menu.
* The execute command includes another condition: `/execute if permission <entity> <permission>` to allow datapacks to
check permissions (e.g. `/execute if permission @s group.admin run say I am an admin!`) 

### Client Side
If the mod is installed on the client, the gamemode switcher can also be accessed, if the player has access to the command, but isn't OP (useful for spigot-based servers)!
